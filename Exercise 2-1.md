# Exercise 2-1

**1. what is a simple graph?**
A simple graph is a graph where edges are not directional in any way an where multipule edges and loops are disallowed.

**2. What is a regular graph?**
Is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbours(every vertex has the same degree).

**2. What is a complete graph?**
A complete graph is a graph where each pair of vertices is joined by an edge and has all possible edges. 

**2. Proof**
See a four vertex graph with all edges.

**3. What is a Path?**
Is a _subgraph_ where all vertices(n >=2) have a degree two except for ther first and last vertices which only have one degree.

**3. What is a Cycle?**
Is a _subgraph_ where all vertices(n >=3) have a degree of two and the first and last vertexes have an edge between them.

**4. What is a Forest?**
A forest is a regular graph where all connected componets are trees.

**4. What is a Tree?**
A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.
